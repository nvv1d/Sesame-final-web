I've reviewed the code and documentation for the Sesame AI Python Client. I understand your challenge - converting this PyAudio-based desktop application into a web application. You're right that PyAudio is the main obstacle since it's designed for desktop environments and won't work in web browsers.
Let me help you create a solution for your research project. I'll design a web-based implementation that maintains the core functionality while adapting to web browser limitations.
First, let's analyze the key components:Analyzed dataView analysisjavascript// Let's identify the key components that need to be adapted for the web:

// 1. PyAudio usage for audio input/output
console.log("Audio handling in current implementation:");
console.log("- Uses PyAudio for microphone input and speaker output");
console.log("- Captures audio in chunks of 1024 samples");
console.log("- Uses sample format paInt16, 1 channel");
console.log("- Input rate: 16000 Hz, Output rate: variable (from server)");

// 2. WebSocket connection
console.log("\nWebSocket connection in current implementation:");
console.log("- Uses custom SesameWebSocket class");
console.log("- Requires authentication token");
console.log("- Sends/receives audio data in real-time");
console.log("- Has callbacks for connect/disconnect events");

// 3. Authentication
console.log("\nAuthentication in current implementation:");
console.log("- Uses TokenManager for handling authentication tokens");
console.log("- Supports anonymous account creation");
console.log("- Manages token refresh");

// 4. Voice activity detection
console.log("\nVoice activity detection in current implementation:");
console.log("- Analyzes audio amplitude to detect speech");
console.log("- Sends silent data after detecting silence for a threshold period");

// Now, let's identify Web APIs that can replace PyAudio:
console.log("\nWeb alternatives for PyAudio:");
console.log("- getUserMedia API: For microphone access");
console.log("- AudioContext API: For audio processing");
console.log("- MediaRecorder API: For recording audio");
console.log("- Web Audio API: For manipulating audio data");
console.log("- WebSocket API: Native browser support for WebSockets");
OutputResult

Audio handling in current implementation:
- Uses PyAudio for microphone input and speaker output
- Captures audio in chunks of 1024 samples
- Uses sample format paInt16, 1 channel
- Input rate: 16000 Hz, Output rate: variable (from server)

WebSocket connection in current implementation:
- Uses custom SesameWebSocket class
- Requires authentication token
- Sends/receives audio data in real-time
- Has callbacks for connect/disconnect events

Authentication in current implementation:
- Uses TokenManager for handling authentication tokens
- Supports anonymous account creation
- Manages token refresh

Voice activity detection in current implementation:
- Analyzes audio amplitude to detect speech
- Sends silent data after detecting silence for a threshold period

Web alternatives for PyAudio:
- getUserMedia API: For microphone access
- AudioContext API: For audio processing
- MediaRecorder API: For recording audio
- Web Audio API: For manipulating audio data
- WebSocket API: Native browser support for WebSocketsBased on my analysis, I'll create a web application that adapts the Sesame AI Python Client to work in browsers. This will involve creating both a server-side component (to handle authentication) and a client-side component (to handle audio).
Here's my approach:
